STEVIE Source Release

This is a source release of the STEVIE editor, a public domain clone
of the UNIX editor 'vi'. The program was originally developed for the
Atari ST, but has been ported to UNIX, OS/2, BSD 4.3 and the Amiga as well.

There are currently two divergent versions of STEVIE. This version is the one
that was ported to the Amiga and then worked on by me (G. R. Walter). The other
one Tony Andrews continued to work on. My version is faster in some respects
then his version, and his version does a couple of things mine doesn't. 

The files included in this release are:

README
	This file.

stevie.doc
	Reference manual for STEVIE. Assumes familiarity with vi.

	C source and header files for STEVIE.

To compile STEVIE for one of the provided systems:

	1. Compile the regular expression library and install as
	   appropriate for your system.

	2. Edit the file 'env.h' to set the system defines as needed.

	3. Check the makefile for your system, and modify as needed.

	4. Compile.

NOTE: implicit in the design is the assumption that char's are unsigned. Thus
      if your compiler assumes different by default, change the default or
      you may have to change the source.
