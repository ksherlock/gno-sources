 * First modification of the regexp library. Added an external variable
 * 'reg_ic' which can be set to indicate that case should be ignored.
 * Added a new parameter to regexec() to indicate that the given string
 * comes from the beginning of a line and is thus eligible to match
 * 'beginning-of-line'.
