To Do
-----

- Fix the update routines to not redisplay the whole bloody screen every
  time a line is inserted or a character is typed.  This may require 
  adding IIgs support for InsertLine and DeleteLine.

- Change the static buffers for insert/undo/redo/undoundo/etc to dynamic
  buffers.

- Add #'d and named buffers.
  IE. "xp = pull text from buffer x

- Add 'U'.

- Add { and } (move paragraph back and forward).

- In cmdline.c make get_range() give the appropriate error messages when it
  gets a bad line range.

- Add & (do last search and replace on current line) and :[range]&
  (do last search and replace on the range of lines).

- add :set wrapmargin command
- add :set shiftwidth command
- add :set autowrite command
- add :set showmode command

- should be able to d/pat
- should be able to ^d (backspace over entire indent (for :set ai))
- should be able to ^X and ^W in input mode

- should support '!' filters
- should support mode lines

- add checks for out of memory when strsave() is used

- after a screen resize, make sure cmdline stuff is re-displayed
