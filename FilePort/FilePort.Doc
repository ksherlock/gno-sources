FilePort is a Port Driver that simply prints to a file (instead of a
printer port).  If you need to capture output from a printer driver
to print something on a printer you don't own then this port driver
might be what you're looking for.  The only restriction that this
software has is that appletalk printer drivers aren't supported
(so don't try using this port driver with the laserwriter driver,
you'll crash into the monitor).

NullPort is another Port Driver - this port driver doesn't print to
anything.  It seems kind of strange, but this is actually very usefull.
Especially when you want to time the performance of a printer driver.
Almost everyone assumes the printer driver is the slow part, when actually
the slowest portions of printing are typically the transfering of data
to the printer and actually printing.  This port driver can be used by
anyone to time just about any printer driver (again, the laserwriter
driver isn't supported).

Requirements: An Apple IIGS with probably 1.5 meg of memory or more,
possibly a hard disk drive and system software 5.0.4 or later.  The
FilePort driver uses a 64k buffer so you'll need at least that much
free memory to be able to use it to print to a file.

Installation: Copy all of the files in this archive to your system
disk and put them in your system:drivers folder.  Select the direct
connect printer control panel document and choose FilePort (or NullPort)
from the port driver list. To change the folder where printer data
files will be generated, simply edit the FilePort.Data file with any
text editor and change the pathname.

These programs are FreeWare - Do anything you want to with them.

The sources to these programs are available to programmers that are
interested - simply send me a blank diskette (3.5" only) and a self
addressed and stamped return diskette mailer. The sources are a
collection or Orca/C and Orca/M. That brings up the runtime libraries
of Orca/C so here goes:

     This program contains material from the Orca/C

I would also like Apple II DTS and Development for their Technotes
on printer port drivers - without them I wouldn't have been able to
write these drivers.

If your computer does something strange with this software then
please tell me about it - I'd be interested in what went wrong.
