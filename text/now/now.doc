    NOW

Version 1.2

There are no parameters for now.  Note that now's output might be 
considered offensive by some.  You've been warned.  People who don't
read doc files first (or look at movie ratings or read reviews etc...)
don't deserve to be protected from 'obscenity'.

In any case, now uses VERY random numbers (the x and y positions of the 
electron gun in the monitor) to generate some (usually) funny statements.
Give it a try...

Update notes:
   v1.2 - 'now' now returns a 0 from main, so it doesn't stop Orca batch files.
