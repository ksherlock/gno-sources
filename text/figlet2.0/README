About figlet (Frank, Ian & Glenn's Letters) release 2.0, August 5, 1993
----------------------------------------------------------------------

figlet is a program that creates large characters out of ordinary
screen characters.  figlet can create characters in many different
styles and can "smush" these characters together in various ways.
figlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many
people like to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages.  Some
example figlet output is given below.

If you like figlet (hey, even if you _hate_ figlet), please send an
e-mail message to <spectre@uiuc.edu>.

[Note: Apple IIGS GNO users having no "C" compiler can contact Jawaid
Bazyar at <bazyar@csn.org> for a pre-compiled GNO version of figlet.]


Files
-----

README    -- This file.
figlet.c  -- The figlet source code.
Makefile  -- The figlet makefile.  Used by the make command.
figlet.6  -- The figlet man(ual) page.
<xxx>.flf -- All files ending in ".flf" are figlet font files.


Installing figlet
-----------------

First decide in which directory the figlet font files (the ".flf"
files) will be stored (e.g., "/usr/games/lib/figlet.dir") and which
will be the default font (we recommend "standard.flf").

Edit "Makefile", and set the variables DEFAULTFONTDIR, DEFAULTFONTFILE
and OLD_DIR_STRUCTS to the appropriate values.  Set DEFAULTFONTDIR to
be the full pathname of the directory in which you will keep the figlet
font files.  Set DEFAULTFONTFILE to be the filename of the default
font.  OLD_DIR_STRUCTS should normally be 0.  For example,

DEFAULTFONTDIR = /usr/games/lib/figlet.dir
DEFAULTFONTFILE = standard.flf
OLD_DIR_STRUCTS = 0

Then, in the directory with the figlet source in it, type "make".

If the program fails to compile, set OLD_DIR_STRUCTS to 1 in Makefile,
and type "make" again.  (Setting OLD_DIR_STRUCTS to 1 makes figlet use
an older method of reading directories.  On newer systems, this method
will often compile without errors, but will not run properly, so
OLD_DIR_STRUCTS should only be set to 1 if figlet will not compile
otherwise.)

Once figlet has been compiled, the ".flf" files go into the directory
you decided to put them in, "figlet" (the executable file) goes
wherever you put executable files (say, in "/usr/games"), and
"figlet.6" goes in section 6 of the man pages, if you want.  If you put
"figlet.6" into section 6, you can read it by typing "man figlet".
Otherwise, try "nroff -man figlet.6 | more".

If space is a problem, the only files you absolutely must have to run
figlet are "figlet" (the executable) and at least one font (preferably
the one you chose to be the default font).

We have successfully compliled figlet on the following systems:

Hardware              Operating System

Sun SPARC             SunOS V4.1.3
SGI Iris 4D/25GT      IRIX V4.0.5
SGI Iris 4D/340VGX    IRIX V4.0.5
SGI Iris Skywriter    IRIX V4.0.5
Cray 2                UNICOS V6.1
Cray Y-MP             UNICOS V6.1
Sequent S81           DYNIX V3.1.1
Convex C240           ConvexOS V10.1
IBM RS/6000           AIX V3
HP 9000/375           HP-UX V7.0
NeXT Mach             NeXTstep V3.0


Using figlet
------------

At the shell prompt, type "figlet".  Then type, say, "Hello, world!"
and press return.  "Hello, world!" in nice, big, designer characters
should appear on your screen.  If you chose standard.flf to be the
default font, you should see
 _   _      _ _                             _     _ _ 
| | | | ___| | | ___    __      _____  _ __| | __| | |
| |_| |/ _ \ | |/ _ \   \ \ /\ / / _ \| '__| |/ _` | |
|  _  |  __/ | | (_) |   \ V  V / (_) | |  | | (_| |_|
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___( )   \_/\_/ \___/|_|  |_|\__,_(_)
                    |/                                
(By the way, the above is meant to be diplayed in a monospaced font.)
Then type something else, or type an EOF (typically control-D) to quit
figlet.

Now you can send the output of figlet to a file (e.g., "figlet > file")
and e-mail it to your friends (who will probably say, "Wow!  It must
have taken you hours to put that together!")

To use other fonts, use the "-f" command line option.  For example, if
you had said "figlet -f smslant" above, you would have seen
   __  __    ____                         __   ____
  / /_/ /__ / / /__      _    _____  ____/ /__/ / /
 / __  / -_) / / _ \_   | |/|/ / _ \/ __/ / _  /_/ 
/_/ /_/\__/_/_/\___( )  |__,__/\___/_/ /_/\_,_(_)  
                   |/                              

Here are some other useful command line options:

-c  center -- centers the output of figlet.
-t  terminal -- figlet asks your terminal how wide it is, and uses
    this to determine when to break lines.  Normally, figlet assumes
    80 columns so that people with wide terminals won't annoy the
    people they e-mail figlet output to.
-D  Deutsch -- switches to the German character set.  Turns `[', `\'
    and `]' to umlauted A, O and U, respectively.  `{', `|' and `}'
    turn into the respective lower case versions of these.  `~' turns
    into s-z.
-p  paragraph mode -- eliminates some spurious line breaks when piping
    a multi-line file through figlet.
-F  Fonts -- lists the available figlet fonts.
-v  version -- prints information about your copy of figlet.

For in-depth explanations of these and other otions, see the man page.


Other Stuff
-----------

Although you don't have to design your own fonts to use figlet, we'd
certainly like it if lots of people did make up new figlet fonts.  If
you feel like giving it a try, see the "FONT FILE FORMAT" section of
the man page.

See "Other Things to Try" in the EXAMPLES section of the man page
for...  well... other things to try.


Authors
-------

figlet was written mostly by Glenn Chappell <ggc@uiuc.edu>.  The
author not being an e-mail fanatic, most correspondence (bug reports,
rave reviews, etc.) should be directed to his secretary (who is
definitely an e-mail fanatic), Ian Chai <spectre@uiuc.edu>.
