The GNO/ME 1.1 libraries are organized as follows:

libc:
  Anything from the Unix C Libraries (Section 3 manpages).

libgno:
  GNO/ME Kernel Interface Functions

lregexp:
  Regular expression package

ltermcap:
  Terminal Capability Database package

Since libraries under ORCA must be ordered topologically (i.e., a library
function foo() that references a library function bar() must come _after_
bar() in the library search order, or be in the same library) we have put
as many routines as possible into libc.
