    QTIME
============

Version 1.3
  Tim Meekins

Added optimizations
Removed newlines from "ding dong".
(NOTE: ding dong's should only happen on the hour, but I had them once
 occur on the half hour).
Fixed several 'bong' bugs.
Stack size is now set to 1024.

---------

Version 1.2

Displays time in real English, also chimes.


Update notes:

  v1.2 - fixed Qtime so main returns 0 and doesn't kill shell scripts (jb)
