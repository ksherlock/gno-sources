NAME
    lseg - list segments in an OMF file

SYNOPSIS
    lseg file ...

DESCRIPTION
    lseg lists the segments of an OMF executable file.  While it can
    list the segments in an intermediate object file, the information
    isn't as useful.

    lseg is intended for discovering the location of stack segments in
    existing applications (for editing to smaller sizes), as an
    aid in determining how to segment large C files whose segments
    exceed the bank size, and for deciding which segments to recombine
    after excessive segmentation.

BUGS
    Doesn't detect non-OMF files, and thus can get very confused if you
    do "lseg *" and one of the files chosen isn't an OMF file.
