This somewhat simplistic version of the GSI NDA is simply a first
quick hack at the program.  In the future I intend to program direct
screen writing code into the NDA to allow ultra-quick scrolling and
redraws, as well as simplify implementation of a terminal emulation:
GNOcon at first, but vt100 eventually.. in other words, GSI NDA will
be 'Xterm' in a nutshell.

You _must_ have at least the GNO 1.0 versions of gsh and the kernel
to use GSI NDA.

Make sure prefix 31 is set in your gshrc file.  Prefix 31 must contain
a directory that contains a directory called "/bin/".

Example:
in gshrc:
  prefix 31 /hard1

Must be the files:
/hard1/bin	                bin directory
/hard1/bin/gsh1.0	        copy of v1.0 of the gno shell

Unfortunately, none of the components of GNO 1.0 are smart enough to locate
gsh in all cases, so we require that you make a copy of gsh as "gsh1.0",
and place it in that bin directory.

If all else fails, if you have ORCA/C, you can edit 'pipe.c' to change
the place GSI NDA looks for gsh.

GNO V1.1 will address this problem in a comprehensive manner.

Good luck, and enjoy!
