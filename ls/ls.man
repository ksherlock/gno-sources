NAME
     ls - list contents of directory

SYNOPSIS
     ls [ -acdfilqrstu1ACLFR ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     For each directory argument, ls lists the contents of the
     directory; for each file argument, ls repeats its name and
     any other information requested.  By default, the output is
     sorted alphabetically.  When no argument is given, the
     current directory is listed.  When several arguments are
     given, the arguments are first sorted appropriately, but
     file arguments are processed before directories and their
     contents.

     There are a large number of options:

     -l   List in long format, giving mode, number of links,
	  owner, size in bytes, and time of last modification for
	  each file.  If the file is a special file the size
	  field will instead contain the major and minor device
	  numbers.  If the file is a symbolic link the pathname
	  of the linked-to file is printed preceded by ``->''.

     -t   Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by
	  name.

     -a   List all entries; in the absence of this option,
	  entries whose names begin with a period (.) or whose GS/OS
	  'invisible' flag is set are not listed.

     -A   List all entries except for the current directory (.)
	  and the parent directory (..).

     -s   Give size in kilobytes of each file.

     -d   If argument is a directory, list only its name; often
	  used with -l to get the status of a directory.

     -L   If argument is a symbolic link, list the file or direc-
	  tory the link references rather than the link itself.
	  Note that if the link references a directory the link
	  is always followed, unless the -l option is used.

     -r   Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic or
	  oldest first as appropriate.

     -u   Use time of last access instead of last modification
	  for sorting (with the -t option) and/or printing (with
	  the -l option).

     -c   Use time of file creation for sorting or printing.

     -i   For each file, print the i-number in the first column
	  of the report.

     -f   Force each argument to be interpreted as a directory
	  and list the name found in each slot.  This option
	  turns off -l, -t, -s, and -r, and turns on -a; the
	  order is the order in which entries appear in the
	  directory.

     -F   Cause directories to be marked with a trailing `/',
	  sockets with a trailing `=', executable files with a
	  trailing `*', and symbolic links to files with a trail-
	  ing `@'.  Symbolic links to directories are marked with
	  a trailing `/', unless the -l option is also used.

     -R   recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -1   force one entry per line output format; this is the
	  default when output is not to a terminal.

     -C   force multi-column output; this is the default when
	  output is to a terminal.

     -q   force printing of non-graphic characters in file names
	  as the character `?'; this is the default when output
	  is to a terminal.

     The mode printed under the -l option contains 11 characters
     which are interpreted as follows: the first character is

     d	if the entry is a directory;
     b	if the entry is a block-type special file;
     c	if the entry is a character-type special file;
     l	if the entry is a symbolic link;
     s	if the entry is a socket, or
     -	if the entry is a plain file.

     The next 9 characters are interpreted as three sets of three
     bits each.  The first set refers to owner permissions; the
     next refers to permissions to others in the same user-group;
     and the last to all others.  Within each set the three char-
     acters indicate permission respectively to read, to write,
     or to execute the file as a program.  For a directory, `exe-
     cute' permission is interpreted to mean permission to search
     the directory.  The permissions are indicated as follows:

     r	if the file is readable;
     w	if the file is writable;
     x	if the file is executable;
     -	if the indicated permission is not granted.

     The group-execute permission character is given as s if the
     file has the set-group-id bit set; likewise the user-execute
     permission character is given as s if the file has the set-
     user-id bit set.

     The last character of the mode (normally `x' or `-') is t if
     the 1000 bit of the mode is on.  See chmod(1) for the mean-
     ing of this mode.


     When the sizes of the files in a directory are listed, a
     total count of blocks, including indirect blocks is printed.

FILES
     /etc/passwd to get user id's for `ls -l' if NetInfo is not
     running.
     /etc/group to get group id's for `ls -g' if NetInfo is not
     running.

SEE ALSO
     netinfo(5)

BUGS
     Newline and tab are considered printing characters in file
     names.

     The output device is assumed to be 80 columns wide.

     The option setting based on whether the output is a teletype
     is undesirable as ``ls -s'' is much different than
     ``ls -s | lpr''.  On the other hand, not doing this setting
     would make old shell scripts which used ls almost certain
     losers.
