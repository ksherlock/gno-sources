Okay, less, for GNO:

if you use the newest version of MAN (v1.6), then set pager=less will let you
use less as your pager.

copy less.hlp to 31:bin so that less can find its help file.

copy less to 31:bin and type rehash to get it updated in your path.

Thats all there is to it, enjoy.

many thanks go to Jawaid Bazyar for his assembly added to 2 routines for screen
updating, as it was a major speed increase.

the termcap file included is fixed for less and alot of other utilities.
please, copy this to your 31:etc directory or there will be problems.
