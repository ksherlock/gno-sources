1.1p4.1 (jb)
	In io.c/putbak, there is a check to make sure the putbak buffer
doesn't overflow.  This was incorrectly checking against the size of MAXLINE
instead of MAXPBB.

1.1p3.4
	Well, guess what?  I caused a hell of an error in the last version of this, and now it is fixed.  The problem stemmed from a library error and has been fixed.  All thanks to Jawaid for creating and fixing the error all by himself.  (no flame to ya Jawaid...heh)

1.1p3.3
        Fixed the problem with nroffing the LESS manpage.  I don't really know
how the hell I fixed it, but that bug is now gone.  I also optimized the source
to a great extent.  There is no real speed increase in output, but the executable is MUCH smaller than the original posted version.  Enjoy.

[previous versions]
        Well, first release.  The versions suck for now till I can figure out
a better way to do it.  It worked, but had bugs.
